Just me (trying) to do Advent of Code and learning C.

Trying my best to only refer to man pages and avoid examples (unless included by manpages) altogether.

== Learned

* (1) concepts: reading files, dynamically sized arrays, realloc,
                correct malloc usage
      methods:  qsort, strto*
